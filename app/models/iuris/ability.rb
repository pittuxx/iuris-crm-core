      #     can :manage, :all

      #
      # The first argument to `can` is the action you are giving the user 
      # permission to do.
      # If you pass :manage it will apply to every action. Other common actions
      # here are :read, :create, :update and :destroy.
      #
      # The second argument is the resource the user can perform the action on. 
      # If you pass :all it will apply to every resource. Otherwise pass a Ruby
      # class of the resource.
      #
      # The third argument is an optional hash of conditions to further filter the
      # objects.
      # For example, here the user can only update published articles.
      #
      #   can :update, Article, :published => true
